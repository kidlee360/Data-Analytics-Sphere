# AnalyticsSphere

This is the monorepo for the AnalyticsSphere application.

## Packages

-   `packages/client`: Next.js/React frontend
-   `packages/server`: Node.js/Express backend

## Getting Started

1.  Install dependencies from the root directory:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
2.  Set up the environment variables for the `server` package by creating a `.env` file in `packages/server`.
3.  Run both the client and server concurrently in development mode:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the Next.js development server for the client and the Express server for the backend.
